## Reshaping Data

## Reshaping Data

Sometimes you need to reshape your data 

- from wide to long
- or vice versa


## Wide to Long

Use the <span class='pack'>tidyr</span> package

<span class='func'>gather</span> will take wide data melt it

- **key** is the new variable name, labels are the original variable names
- **value** is the name of the new variable that will contain their values

```{r wide2long, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, echo=-c(1)}
library(tidyr)
bballLong = bball %>% 
  select(Player, Tm, FG., X3P., X2P., trueShooting, effectiveFG) %>%
  rename(fieldGoalPerc = FG., threePointPerc = X3P., twoPointPerc = X2P.) %>% 
  gather(key = 'vitalInfo', value = 'value', -Tm, -Player) 

bballLong %>% head
```


## Long to wide

Going the reverse direction - use <span class="func">spread</span>

```{r long2wide, cache=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
bballLong %>%
  spread(vitalInfo, value) %>% 
  head
```
