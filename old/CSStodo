Get rid of slide numbering - Done (good for both Firefox and Chrome)
Align code to text - Done (nothing has changed, but the code is there to do it)
Add emphs - Done (color is #ff5500 and italicized)
Change title slide font/color - Done (currently set to #ff5500)
Code font smaller - Done (currently set to 10px)
